<h1 align="center">Hi 👋, I'm Harmanpreet Singh</h1>



⚡ Data Analyst | Power BI Developer | Python & SQL Enthusiast

Turning data chaos into business clarity — one dashboard at a time.



🌟 About Me


I’m Harmanpreet Singh, a data analyst who believes that numbers tell stories — if you know how to listen.

I specialize in transforming raw, scattered datasets into structured insights that not only explain what happened but also reveal why it happened and what should happen next.

I approach every dataset like a puzzle — cleaning it, shaping it, and connecting its patterns until it reveals something truly meaningful. Whether it’s visualizing business performance in Power BI, optimizing data pipelines using SQL, or exploring insights with Python, I strive to turn data into decisions.

For me, data analytics isn’t about charts — it’s about clarity, curiosity, and creating impact.
When I’m not building dashboards, you’ll find me exploring new analytical tools, automating workflows, or experimenting with cleaner, smarter ways to tell stories with data.
